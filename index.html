  <h1>For Ruchika</h1>
  <p>My dearest Ruchika,</p>
  <p>I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to me. You bring so much joy and happiness into my life, and I am incredibly grateful to have you by my side.</p>
  <p>Every moment with you is a treasure, and I cherish the love and laughter we share together. You are the most beautiful person, both inside and out, and I feel so lucky to call you mine.</p>
  <p>Ruchika, you are my sunshine on the darkest days, and my rock when I need support. I love you more than words can express, and I can't wait to create many more beautiful memories with you.</p>
  <p>Forever and always,</p>
  <p class="love-note">Your Name</p>
